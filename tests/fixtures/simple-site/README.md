# simple-site Fixture

This is a minimal static site used as a fixture for Langshake CLI integration tests.

- Contains two pages: `about.html` and `contact.mdx`. Only `about.html` is used for JSON-LD extraction in the current pipeline.
- Used to verify end-to-end CLI extraction, JSON-LD generation, and index building from built HTML files.
