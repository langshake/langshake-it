### 🧠 Context7 MCP Usage
- **Always use the context7 MCP server** to reference documentation.
- For the tokens, **use the default 5000**.
- **Only search three times maximum for any specific piece of documentation.** If you don’t get what you need, use the Brave MCP server to perform a wider search.

### 🔄 Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read `planning.md` and `whitepaper.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `task.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn’t listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `planning.md`.

### 🧱 Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (ES6-style `import` / `export` preferred if supported).
### 🧪 Testing & Reliability
- **Always create Vitest unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc).
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Tests should live in a `/tests` or `__tests__` folder** mirroring the main app structure.
  - Include at least:
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case

### ✅ Task Completion
- **Mark completed tasks in `task.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `task.md` under a “Discovered During Work” section.

### 📎 Style & Conventions
- **Use JavaScript** (or TypeScript, if the project uses it).
- **Follow ESLint and Prettier rules**. Format code with `prettier`.
- **Use `zod` for data validation**.
- Use **Express.js** for building APIs and **Prisma** for database ORM.
- Write **JSDoc comments** for every function in this style:
  ```js
  /**
   * Brief summary.
   *
   * @param {type} param1 - Description.
   * @returns {type} Description.
   */
  function example(param1) {
    // ...
  }
  ```

### 📚 Documentation & Explainability
- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `// Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.

### 🧠 AI Behavior Rules
- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** – only use known, verified JavaScript packages.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `TASK.md`.
- **Never hardcode or read the value of environemnt variables** do define them in the '.env.example' file and only user can add them.
